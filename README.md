## What Ensight Offers: 

● Film Logging: Users can easily log the films they watch, capturing details such as title, date watched, and personal ratings.
● Film Reviews: Users can write and publish reviews of films, sharing their thoughts, opinions, and analysis.
● Film Lists: Users can create and share lists of films, such as "Top 10 Films of the Year" or "Favorite Horror Movies." Expanding user-generated lists with more options for categorization, filtering, and ranking would enable users to curate and discover film lists more effectively.
● Film Ratings: Users can rate films on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, allowing others to quickly see their overall opinion.
● Social Interaction: The platform encourages social interaction among users. You can follow others, like and comment on reviews, and engage in discussions.
● Film Discovery: Personalized recommendations, user-curated lists, and expert reviews aid in discovering new films.
